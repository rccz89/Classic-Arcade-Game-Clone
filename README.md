# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Important Note

This is the second project of the intermediate JavaScript section for Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree.

## How the Game Works

- The player can move left, right, up and down.
- The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board.
- Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square.
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won.
